## Final Project
The initial goal of our final project was to develop a self-driving car with the capability of detecting and avoiding objects while staying on its path. However, due to time constraints of taking this course, MAE 148, over the summer, we had to shift our goal into a more realistic one by having the car just detect and avoid objects. Below is a summary of our goals, what we achieved, and what did not go as expected and/or planned.
